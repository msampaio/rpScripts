# Rhythmic Partitioning Scripts

This repository contains Rhythmic Partitioning Scripts (aka RP Scripts). This program is part of a paper written by [Marcos Sampaio](https://marcos.sampaio.me) and [Pauxy Gentil-Nunes](https://pauxy.net) and published at [Brazilian Journal of Music and Mathematics (MusMat)](https://musmat.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/02-Sampaio-Gentil-Nunes-V6N2_2022.pdf). The paper describes the RP Scripts' functionalities and operation.

RP Scripts are command-line Python scripts designed to extract rhythmic partitioning information from given digital music scores files, plot partitiogram and indexogram, and to create annotated digital music scores files.

RP Scripts reads MusicXML (compressed or not) and Kern files and generates RP data in CSV files as well as partitioning charts.

## Install

RP Scripts are written in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and need some libraries listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

If you are not familiar with Python and its libraries, follow these steps:

1. Download and install Python 3 (check https://www.python.org/downloads/).
1. Download this repository.
1. Open a terminal (command prompt in Windows) and go to this repository's folder in your computer. For instance, `cd C:\Users\myName\rpScripts` (Windows) or `cd /Users/myName/rpScripts` (Mac).
1. Install the libraries with Python's `PIP` program: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Components and usage

RP Scripts comprises three standalone scripts:

- RPC: Rhythmic Partitioning Calculator
- RPP: Rhythmic Partitioning Plotter
- RPA: Rhythmic Partitioning Annotator

These scripts are available at [src](src/README.md) folder.

Some examples of their usage are available at [examples](examples/README.md) folder.

### RPC

RPC processes the given digital score and returns a CSV file with partitions' information.

    python rpc.py score.xml

Since RPC uses Music21 library, it accepts MusicXML, MXL (compressed MusicXML) and Kern files as input.

CSV file output contains:

1. Index (`measure number + offset`)
1. Measure number
1. Offset
1. Global offset
1. Duration
1. Partition
1. Density number
1. Agglomeration index
1. Dispersion index

RPC returns a CSV file such as

```csv
"Index","Measure number","Offset","Global offset","Duration","Partition","Density-number","Agglomeration","Dispersion"
"1+0",1,0,0,1/4,"0",0,"",""
"1+1/4",1,1/4,1/4,3/2,"1.3",4,3.0,3.0
"1+1/2",1,1/2,1/2,3/2,"1.3",4,3.0,3.0
"2+0",2,0,3/4,3/2,"1.3",4,3.0,3.0
"2+1/4",2,1/4,1,3/2,"1.3",4,3.0,3.0
"2+1/2",2,1/2,5/4,3/2,"1.3",4,3.0,3.0
"2+3/4",2,3/4,3/2,3/2,"1.3",4,3.0,3.0
"2+1",2,1,7/4,1,"4",4,6.0,0.0
"2+5/4",2,5/4,2,1,"4",4,6.0,0.0
"2+3/2",2,3/2,9/4,1,"4",4,6.0,0.0
"2+7/4",2,7/4,5/2,1,"4",4,6.0,0.0
```

### RPP

RPP return partitiogram and indexogram from a given CSV file generated by RPC. The basic files are generated with:

    python rpp.py score.csv

Obs: All the examples below are related to Robert Schumann's op. 48, n. 2.

![Indexogram](examples/schumann-opus48no2-indexogram.svg)

*Indexogram*

RPP accepts multiple options to define image format, resolution, indexogram type, among other stuff.

#### Image format

To set the chart images format use `-f` option. Otherwise, they will be generated as svg format.

    python rpp.py -f svg score.csv
    python rpp.py -f png score.csv
    python rpp.py -f jpg score.csv

#### Image resolution

When an image format such as JPG or PNG is defined use `-r` to set its resolution:

    python rpp.py -f png -r 300 score.csv

#### Closing bubbles

To plot vertical lines closing indexogram bubbles, use `-c` option:

    python rpp.py -c score.csv

![Indexogram with closing lines](examples/schumann-opus48no2-indexogram-closing.svg)

*Indexogram with closing lines*

#### Stem style

Use `-e` to plot indexogram in stem style:

    python rpp.py -e score.csv

![Indexogram as stem chart](examples/schumann-opus48no2-indexogram-stem.svg)

*Indexogram as stem chart*

#### Stairs style

Use `-t` to plot indexogram in stairs style:

    python rpp.py -t score.csv

![Indexogram as stair chart](examples/schumann-opus48no2-indexogram-stairs.svg)

*Indexogram as stair chart*

#### Combined style

Use `-b` to plot indexogram in combined style:

    python rpp.py -b score.csv

![Indexogram as combined chart](examples/schumann-opus48no2-indexogram-combined.svg)

*Indexogram as combined chart*

#### All charts

Use `-a` to plot all available indexogram types charts:

    python rpp.py -a score.csv

### RPA

RPA generates annotated digital score from a given score and CSV file generated by RPC.

    python rpa.py -s score.xml -c score.csv
