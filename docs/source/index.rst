RP Scripts' documentation
=========================

RP Scripts is an open-source command-line program designed to extract rhythmic partitioning information from given digital music scores files, plot partitiogram and indexogram, and create annotated digital music scores files.

This program reads MusicXML (compressed or not), and Kern files generating rhythmic partitioning data in JSON files and partitioning charts. It uses the `Music21 <https://mit.edu/music21>`_ library for score parsing and `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_ for chart plotting.

Some published papers describe
RP Scripts' features (See Section :doc:`bibliography`). The software is available at https://github.com/msampaio/rpScripts.

This program is an `HMB Project <https://marcos.sampaio.me/en/project/haydn-mozart-beethoven/>`_ outcome.
